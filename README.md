# Experiment-4-Single-Server-with-infinite-Capacity-Queueing-Model
# Aim
To find
(a)	Average number of materials in the system 
(b)	Average number of materials in the conveyor
(c)	Waiting time of each material in the system
(d)	Waiting time of each material in the conveyor

If the arrival of materials follow poisson process with mean interval time 12 seconds, service time of lathe machine follows exponential distribution with mean service time 1 second and average service time of robot is 7 seconds.
# Software Required:  Visual Components and Python
# Theory:
1.	The model has one server and unlimited queue space, so any number of customers can wait without blocking new arrivals.
2.	Arrivals usually follow a Poisson process, and service times come from a chosen probability distribution, often exponential in the classic M/M/1 case.
3.	 The system reaches a stable steady state only when the service rate exceeds the arrival rate; otherwise the queue grows without bound.
4.	 Key performance measures—like average waiting time, average queue length, and server utilization—emerge from the balance between these two rates.
5.	 Despite its simplicity, the model serves as a foundational benchmark for analysing more intricate queueing systems and real-world service operations.
